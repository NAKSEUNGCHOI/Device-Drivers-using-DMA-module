## Description
- STM32f411RE Nucleo Bare-metal programming.
- These should be good source codes/examples for those who study bare-metal programming with any STM32 board.

## Getting started

### Installing
- This is done using STMCubeIDE.
- Download STMCubeIDE @ [https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html).
